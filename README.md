# redwine
End to End trial on red wine dataset

Libraries Used:
1. Pandas
2. Sklearn
3. Numpy 
4. Seaborn
5. Matplotlib
6. Flask
7. Pickle

Goal:
Using the redwine dataset the main goal of the project is to make an end to end machine learning project.
After analysing the data we create a model using Random Forest Classification as it gave the best performance, the model is then deployed on platforms such as Flask and Docker.
